documentation: |-
    This block works with the xcorrelate block correlation message output.  It will extract the desired delay from the correlated_lags output vector.  Note that for signals going into that block, signal[1] will be referenced as index 0 in the output vectors.  A minimum correlation score can be set to limit when triggered updates will happen.  Correlation scores will range from -1.0 to 1.0 (exactly correlated).  Setting the value to -1.0 will effectively disable it.  Setting it to 1.0 would require an exact match (which would include system noise).
